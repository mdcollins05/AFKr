This project may not work with the latest Bukkit version (or at all) and may not receive any further updates by myself however, feel free to fork this and make improvements. I'll certainly consider any pull requests made and will try to assist with any issues.

#AFKr

What it does:
- Marks players as AFK after a configurable amount of time
- Kicks players who reach a configurable time limit when they are AFK
- Keeps track of player movement within a configurable area (to prevent anti-AFK mods from working)
- Provides a command to view the AFK players
- Complete with permissions for a broadcast message, unkickable players (admins or whomever you choose) via permissions
